## üé® How to Use Custom Overlays

### Creating Overlays
1. **Visit the Online Generator**: Go to [froggba.onrender.com](https://froggba.onrender.com)
2. **Upload Your PNG**: 
   - Image must be exactly 480√ó272 pixels (PSP screen size)
   - Transparent areas will show the game
   - Opaque areas will be the border/bezel
3. **Download OVL File**: Click convert and download the generated .ovl file
4. **Install on PSP**:
   - Copy the .ovl file to `/PSP/GAME/FrogGBA/overlays/` on your Memory Stick
   - Files will appear in the Overlay menu in-game

### Using Overlays in FrogGBA
1. Press **HOME** during gameplay to open the menu
2. Navigate to **Overlay Settings**
3. Select your overlay from the list
4. Adjust X/Y offset if needed to position the game window
5. Enable/disable overlays with the toggle option

### Tips for Best Results
- Design overlays with a transparent center area for the game (240√ó160 minimum)
- Use PNG transparency for see-through areas
- Keep border designs simple to avoid hitting the 30,000 pixel limit
- Test different aspect ratios with your overlays (Core/Zoom/Stretch)
